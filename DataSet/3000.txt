A drinking fountain, also called a water fountain, is a fountain designed to provide drinking water.
It consists of a basin with either continuously running water or a tap. 
The drinker bends down to the stream of water and swallows water directly from the stream.


 Modern indoor drinking fountains may incorporate filters to remove impurities from the water and chillers to lower its temperature.
 Drinking fountains are usually found in public places, like schools, rest areas, libraries, and grocery stores.
